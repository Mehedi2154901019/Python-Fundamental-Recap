# Python-Fundamental-Recap
To build stronger habits and cleaner logic, I focused on writing and testing small blocks of code that previously caused me confusion or bugs in my workflow.

ðŸ“Œ Some of the key topics I practiced:
-Escape sequences
-list comprehension
-Formatted strings
-while loops and control flow
-Math operations using the math library
-Function parameters and arguments
-Ternary operators (single-line if conditions)
-Complex numbers
-String methods like .title() and .replace()
-Chained comparison operators
